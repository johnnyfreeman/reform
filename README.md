# Installation

The recommended way to install Reform is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Just copy the snippet below into your composer.json file and run the `composer install` command to install it:

```javascript
{
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "require": {
        "johnnyfreeman/reform": "*"
    }
}
```

Or, you can download the [reform.zip](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/reform/zipball/master) file and extract it.
